/*Write a program that receives a total of 4 parameters in the format x1, y1, x2, y2. Check if the distance between each point (x, y) and the beginning of the Cartesian coordinate system (0, 0) is valid. A distance between two points is considered valid if it is an integer value. 
 Note: You can use the following formula to help you calculate the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
The order of comparisons should always be first {x1, y1} to {0, 0}, then {x2, y2} to {0, 0} and finally {x1, y1} to {x2, y2}. 
In case a distance is valid, print: `{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is valid`
If the distance is invalid, print: `{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is invalid`
The input consists of two points given as 4 numbers.
For each comparison print either `{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is valid` if the distance is valid, or `{x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is invalid` if it is invalid.
Examples
Input	Output
3, 0, 0, 4	{3, 0} to {0, 0} is valid
{0, 4} to {0, 0} is valid
{3, 0} to {0, 4} is valid
2, 1, 1, 1	{2, 1} to {0, 0} is invalid
{1, 1} to {0, 0} is invalid
{2, 1} to {1, 1} is valid
‚¶Å	*Words Uppercase
Write a program that extracts all words from a passed-in string and converts them to upper case. The extracted words in the upper case must be printed on a single line separated by ", ".
The input comes as a single string argument - the text to extract and convert words from.
The output should be a single line containing the converted string.
